# EventDisplay

At the Longwood Public Library when I was working IT, we had an administrator making an image in GIMP every morning with our events for the day, and putting it on a flash drive to connect to a tv in the main lobby. Given that all of our events were already displayed on our library's home page, I knew that this was something we could automate.

So I created this GUI application with C# WPF that scrapes our home page, and puts the events into categories (Adult/Teen/Children programs) and puts them over the background image the administrator was using.

I'm no longer working for the Longwood Public Library but this is still actively being used today.
